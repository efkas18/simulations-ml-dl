MNIST - Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology

An execution of 10000 observations as input for training and 20000 as testing (evaluation) dataset.
Categorial case with 10 possible classes and 784 features.
Essentially 784 features translated as 28X28 pixels grayscale image, which had been transformed as a 1d array, 
contains at each cell values between 0 and 1.

In this case performed simulation only with ANN model, without contribution of any CNN model to transform image to
numerical representation, because spreadsheets has already the proper numerical on data.
